Q: How long did you spend working on this project?

A: It took me around two weeks, I really liked this assignment.

======================================================

Q: What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

A: implementing find methods and return capability

======================================================

Q: What two additional features did you build? Why?

A: I implemented following Functions
  -A way for customers to return items #As necessary part of inventory
                                              system
  -Added brands #Because i have the seen data before in toycity part 2
                    and felt there should be a brand class
  -Better ways to find transactions #Because finding by id can be
                    sufficient for someone who knows the id of the product
                    but if someone just comes and asks me to generate a
                    report for particular brand, product another_brand
                    customer these new functions would come handy

======================================================

Q: Where do you still have room to grow?

A: I think I can learn more about gem and class related functions.
    Ruby blocks and yield statement and advance topics like gem creation
    and using some libraries like prawn for PDF report generation.
